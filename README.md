# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project focuses on understanding, predicting, and reducing customer churn for a telecommunications company using real customer data. The dataset contains information on customer demographics, subscription plans, service usage, billing, and engagement patterns.
In highly competitive industries like telecommunications, customers can easily switch providers due to pricing, service quality, or better offers. As a result, customer churn directly impacts revenue, growth, and long-term sustainability. The goal of this project is to move beyond simply knowing who left, to understanding why customers leave, which customers are likely to leave next, and what the business can do to prevent it.

Project Goal: Understand, predict, and reduce customer churn using data-driven insights. Identify customers at risk of churn and recommend actionable retention strategies.
